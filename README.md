## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[This challenge was fairly simple however, I did get lost in the middle as I was trying to create the sounds for the buttons,
I got a little confused as I had never used these languages before, however I just backtracked to where I for sure knew I was right and followed the steps more keenly.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I wonder how websites are able to talk to and retrive information from databses so fast? What makes succesful websites such as Amazon, Facebook, etc. so popular compared to others?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add additional levels until the user loses. I would also like to keep track of the high score. Allow a two player method where one player can decide the pattern or they both compete against the computer.]
